# CMPT-1105-variable-definition-or-data-type

In Python, the variable definition or variable data type is the type of the variable.

```
# Python

x = 10 # this is an integer 
x = "Hello, I am Aki" # this is a string
```

In other language such as Java, you will need to declare the variable data type.

```
// Java

String myName = "Hello, I am Aki"
int myNum = 10
```
